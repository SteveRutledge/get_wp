more focused on framework/ecosystem right now rather than content:

[git](https://git-scm.com/): source management  
[github](https://github.com): public remote source repository  
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv): python version manager  
	lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It's simple,  
	unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tools that do  
	one thing well.  
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)   
	is a tool to manage Python packaging and dependencies. Its ease of  
	use and support for modern workflows make it the ideal successor to the  
	venerable setuptools. It is similar to npm and yarn in the JavaScript  
	world, and to other modern package and dependency managers. For  
	alternatives to Poetry, have a look at flit, pipenv, pyflow, and dephell.  
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)   
	unit test framework - somewhat of the de facto standard for python
